        content: "{\"message\":\"Data Showed Successfully\",\"data\":{\"id\":1,\"transcriptId\":1,\"summaryText\":\"**Call Participants:**\\n- Jennifer Abbott\\n- Josh Wilhelm\\n\\n**Meeting Summary:**\\n\\nThe call between Jennifer Abbott and Josh Wilhelm focused on discussing updates for Jennifer Abbott's company website, including content revision and potential additions. Jennifer expressed the need to refresh the website's content, considering the possibility of adding a new page but also contemplating simplifying the site by removing certain elements to make it more basic. She referred to another company, Intrepidus Talent Solutions, as having clearer content and suggested that her site might benefit from a similar approach.\\n\\nJosh Wilhelm introduced the topic of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliance for the website, emphasizing its importance post-COVID and the risk of legal issues without it. He presented a third-party tool for ADA compliance, explaining its features and pricing at approximately $100 per month or $1200 per year, potentially tax-deductible.\\n\\nAnother point of discussion was the need for updated terms and conditions due to new California laws regarding data collection. Josh explained the necessity of this update and the associated cost of around $50 per month or $550 per year.\\n\\nJosh also recommended integrating a service like Calendly to streamline the process of scheduling meetings with potential clients, mentioning a significant increase in his own company's conversion rates after implementing such a system.\\n\\nThe conversation then returned to the website content, where Josh advised against completely removing the \\\"FILL\\\" elements from the site, as they are integral to the branding and still relevant. He suggested updating the content while keeping the structure and possibly adding real human images to modernize the look.\\n\\nJennifer and Josh discussed the importance of content for SEO, with Josh highlighting that Jennifer's site is currently ranked for only a few keywords and lacks the content necessary for better SEO performance. He encouraged using AI tools like ChatGPT to generate content and create a content calendar for blog posts, which would help with SEO and provide detailed information about services.\\n\\nJosh outlined the steps to create a blog section on the website, including the design of a listing page for blog articles and individual blog post pages. He offered to create a tutorial on how to add blog posts to the website once these pages are set up.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n\\n- **Jennifer Abbott:**\\n  - Determine which content needs updating on the homepage and prepare the new text.\\n  - Decide on a service to expand into a detailed blog article and begin drafting it, possibly using AI tools like ChatGPT for assistance.\\n  - Review and decide on the ADA compliance and terms and conditions services once the estimate is provided.\\n  \\n- **Josh Wilhelm:**\\n  - Prepare an estimate for Jennifer Abbott by Friday, including the creation of blog listing and individual blog post pages, as well as separate line items for ADA compliance and terms and conditions services.\\n  - Design the blog listing and individual blog post pages, with the intention of keeping the same design elements as the current homepage.\\n  - Create a tutorial video or loom video to show Jennifer how to add blog posts to the new blog section of her website once it is set up.\\n  \\nThe overall goal of the call was to plan for a website content update, improve SEO through new content creation, and ensure the website's compliance with ADA and data collection laws.\",\"created_at\":\"2023-11-29T18:16:14.000000Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2023-11-29T18:16:14.000000Z\",\"meeting_transcript\":{\"id\":1,\"transcriptText\":\"05:35 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so why you wanted to chat with you is I think but it's also gonna be budget budget pending. 01:46 Josh Wilhelm: Oh. 05:47 Jennifer Abbott: Is I think we need to update our content, especially. 05:52 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. 05:53 Jennifer Abbott: on the site and then like I still love this idea. I love exactly how it looks. I love the pages. I might need to add one additional page, but it might be covered in the content. And then I don't think as far as the whole like. How we had fill in the find out and then on the next one is the information like the f i l l. I think we can probably do away with 06:17 Josh Wilhelm: I probably 06:18 Jennifer Abbott: that and just have human element logo, like now we're branded enough. like just who we like so each page would just be like very basic Who We Are What do I have I have the who the what our services can't like all the same stuff, but just kind of change the content a little bit. And then not necessarily have the f i l l anymore. Like almost a little more basic to be honest. So I I'm there's a website called intrepidus Talent Solutions. And they're the ones who so that it's this. There's two guys one from Florida one from Santa Clarita who just opened like literally just opened up. A recruiting shop similar to ours and it's local and I found out because he posted somewhere that he's involved in the Chamber of Commerce in Santa Cruz and I was like, I'm on the f****** board and I don't even know who you are. 07:24 Josh Wilhelm: I have done. 07:25 Jennifer Abbott: And then I went to his website and I was like, oh their content is like I could totally tell it's called intrepidus. I can totally tell their content is much more communicative than mine. But it really doesn't it's not really that different from our own site. I just need to change the content. 07:49 Josh Wilhelm: Is this the website you're talking about? Yeah. 07:52 Jennifer Abbott: So like if you look at their services. we ought we give you know, all the kind of same thing, but my content isn't that clear? I mean, we don't do all the same stuff. But so I just think I need to update my content a little bit. 08:10 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, so I'm glad we're talking about this. There's a couple different things that we need a look at. So I just realized because I haven't looked at your side in a while. So we need to get ADA compliance set up for your site. 08:28 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 08:29 Josh Wilhelm: You're probably familiar with 88 08:30 Jennifer Abbott: but 08:30 Josh Wilhelm: compliance when it comes to the brick and mortar. 08:32 Jennifer Abbott: yeah. 08:33 Josh Wilhelm: But it back in 2009. I think it was under Obama's administration. It got a modified or it includes now web accessibility. 08:44 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 08:46 Josh Wilhelm: So what? It really wasn't that big of a deal for a lot of businesses pre-covid. 08:54 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 08:54 Josh Wilhelm: During covid and post it's been a big thing that these attorneys are going after small business owners that don't have ADA compliance on their site. 09:03 Jennifer Abbott: right 09:04 Josh Wilhelm: Um, we work with a third party tool. This is what it looks like. Obviously, I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't. have it on our own site, but he sorry my internet's going slow today. It'll in the very least it'll protect you from people these I call them parasitic attorneys going after you this is what it looks like. So it starts off as this little character. You can do like a wheelchair. There's lots of different options to choose from the color that's behind the character can be modified to fit your styling. 09:37 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. Yeah. 09:39 Josh Wilhelm: So like red. So when you click on her when a visitor clicks on it, it allows them to modify your site and multitude a different ways so they can change out 09:47 Jennifer Abbott: right 09:48 Josh Wilhelm: certain colors. They can stop any kind of movements. Although you don't have any real movements on your site. They can increase the font size. They can if certain colors are hard for them to read or see they can change those colors out to different other colors that are easier. And then we see it's all makes it capable for people to see it on an individual basis. However, they need to or want to see it. The software is added to the site. So it'll cover any of your pages that you have on there. And then any new pages that you will add up to a thousand pages and then it moves to the next plan after that, but you will. Come close to that. 10:28 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 10:28 Josh Wilhelm: So all your blog posts any new ones that you're adding would automatically get scanned and then the software would apply to that as well. So you don't have to do anything necessarily different. 10:39 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 10:39 Josh Wilhelm: So this is it works out to be about a hundred bucks a month. You can do it yearly, which it just you know, it's funny how people look at it go. Oh, that's too much when you show them like once a year costs and then you go. 10:52 Jennifer Abbott: right 10:53 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, you do it monthly. It's a hundred bucks a month. Okay, let's yeah, that's that's much more reasonable. It's like it's the same same exact 10:57 Jennifer Abbott: right 10:59 Josh Wilhelm: price. Um, that's one thing that if I were to say out of anything, you definitely need it. We need to get that applied to the site like right away. It doesn't take very long yet apply to the site that cost has everything built into it. So set up can it get in it all prepped on everything you need so that hundred bucks for a month or anything. It works out to like is it 1200 per year? It's also it. Have to check. I don't know if you're still working with Kent for taxes and stuff. 11:33 Jennifer Abbott: Yep. 11:33 Josh Wilhelm: But last year's taxes. It was a write-off. 11:38 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 11:38 Josh Wilhelm: I don't know if it'll be applied the same way this year, but it is I know last year because we have it obviously we pay for it as well. So it was a tax write-off for ourselves. So you already do it. It'd be a text right off for you. I would assume also this year as well. But again, I not a text person so I don't know for sure or not. 11:59 Jennifer Abbott: right 12:00 Josh Wilhelm: The other one is terms and conditions. So it used to be back in the day where you could pretty much scalp. Someone else's terms and conditions off of their website do a search and replace. Replace out that company name for your name update your address on there and all that kind of stuff and you're good. California specifically is passed three new laws in the last six months. If not year that have to do specifically with data collection. So any kind of data collection of any kind on the site form or otherwise? That is you that those three laws in particular have to do that. It also has to do with other things too. But those are the primaries. So this contact form right here where you're collecting information. That's one that I would definitely you need to have terms and conditions. That one's a bit cheaper the good thing about that one and the Ada that works the same way is as the laws adjust the software to adjust automatically for you. 12:59 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 12:59 Josh Wilhelm: So you don't have to do anything after it's been implemented. So when there's new you'll get notifications saying hey, this law has changed or this law has been updated just to let you know. Then you would then be able to be notified immediately right then and there and it'll say in that email. You don't have to do anything. It's already been updated on your terms and conditions. Just more to keep you in the loop of what's going on with the laws. 13:24 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 13:25 Josh Wilhelm: Um, I would recommend for sure those two. 13:30 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 13:30 Josh Wilhelm: the other one that I probably 13:32 Jennifer Abbott: What's the pricing on the terms and 13:33 Josh Wilhelm: recommend 13:33 Jennifer Abbott: conditions then? 13:34 Josh Wilhelm: What's that? 13:35 Jennifer Abbott: What? 13:35 Josh Wilhelm: Oh. The pricing on that one works at the like 50 bucks a month or you pay for a yearly same kind of thing. It's a subscription type thing. It's 550 a year is the yearly 13:47 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 13:47 Josh Wilhelm: so those are those two. To help you from a sales or potential sales point. I would recommend we connect this contact form up to like a calendly. I'm sure you've heard of it. 14:03 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 14:04 Josh Wilhelm: Calendly type service so that when someone fills out the form you're the data that they fill in will automatically populate over onto your calendly and then they can go ahead and book right then and there with you or Andrew whoever's handling the the sales side of things. I will tell you this from our own personal. Piece that we do the exact same thing and we implemented this about a year year and a half ago. Leads would come in fill out the form and then we would have to try and kind of follow back up with them to get them on a in a meeting and it probably are conversion rate from the point. They filled out the form on our site to the point. We got him on to a meeting usually was about 50% 14:47 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 14:47 Josh Wilhelm: since implementing this directly from the fill out the form and immediately they're available to set a day and time has gone up to about a 93% conversion. 14:58 Jennifer Abbott: right 14:59 Josh Wilhelm: So it's a massive help because you don't have to they don't have to wait for you to get back to them and say hey what days and times do you want to meet and let's play ping pong back and forth. This actually allows it in real time for them to be able to book right after. 15:14 Jennifer Abbott: right 15:15 Josh Wilhelm: So just just so you can kind of see what this looks like. So I'll just fill this. Jake I cannot oh my gosh. I can't smoke they alright Okay interested in. And other services, let's say that testing out the contact form with Jen. Okay, send it over so fills out the form then the confirmation page that ends up popping up. Well, then be it says thank you for contacting. Please select a Time below to book appointment. 16:15 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 16:16 Josh Wilhelm: It's an immediately goes there and let's say I picked a 30th. And I selected 9 am. Then it would already have that information. They already filled in ahead of time already pre-populated. And then they would fill in whatever other missing information wasn't filled in from the previous form. If you wanted to collect more 16:35 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 16:36 Josh Wilhelm: information. 16:36 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 16:37 Josh Wilhelm: Have a priority obviously as the first two I mentioned but that would be something that helps with converting the sales. 16:56 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 16:58 Josh Wilhelm: All right. Now, let's go back to your initial request. So my thought process on this is a couple things. One if you get away from this, obviously it gets kind of away from your whole Elemental component that you've got still as part of your 17:13 Jennifer Abbott: that 17:15 Josh Wilhelm: theme. 17:16 Jennifer Abbott: uh-huh. 17:16 Josh Wilhelm: Because if you strip that out, then it kind of goes away with these different parts, right? The other parts I'm thinking about on this is yes, I agree with you. You're much more established than you were in the very beginning when we first set up the site. However, still some of the components that we have on here are pretty much what any website whether you're known or not would contained. 17:39 Jennifer Abbott: Yep, absolutely. 17:40 Josh Wilhelm: So from that standpoint The Fill still applies now. 17:44 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 17:45 Josh Wilhelm: Yes, I agree with you probably some of the content needs. We updated a bit and kind of just 17:49 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 17:49 Josh Wilhelm: current. But I still think your section's 17:52 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 17:53 Josh Wilhelm: apply. 17:54 Jennifer Abbott: That yeah, me too. 17:55 Josh Wilhelm: So 17:57 Jennifer Abbott: Me, too. 17:57 Josh Wilhelm: I would probably keep those would be 17:59 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 17:59 Josh Wilhelm: my suggestion. Now. The other part of this is we have this currently as we built this a long time ago as just a landing page as technically what it is. It's a single page website. Yes, you've got the blog which then builds it out in a more pages, but from a traditional web page standpoint. It's a landing site in comparison to intrepidus this. These are actual Pages. Obviously, it doesn't drop down to a 18:24 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 18:26 Josh Wilhelm: section on the home page. 18:28 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 18:28 Josh Wilhelm: We're being more established. You can go either way. There is nothing that says, oh well, you know doing a single page landing page. It makes you look small or anything like that. I say hogwash that's not true. It just comes down to if you're looking to expand upon the content. That's what tips you over into the side of going individual pages. instead of the individual sections of the page So the way we would probably best do this would be like, let's say they clicked down to find out you have some of this information and then you'd have a button here that says learn more. So you can do it that way and then you could actually put the links up at the top which is you know, instead of these dropping you down to those sections. We could actually change these around a little bit where it's maybe when they hover over the find out when they click on it that drops you down to the find out and then the link up at you know, find out who we are the who we are part would actually take you over to the individual page. 19:32 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. I don't need that. 19:33 Josh Wilhelm: So I kind of both. 19:34 Jennifer Abbott: I really just need a Content update. 19:36 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. But again, it depends on how much content remember people's attention spans are not great. 19:42 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, it's not a lot. 19:43 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, so if it just if it's kind of 19:44 Jennifer Abbott: It just needs their. 19:46 Josh Wilhelm: using the same generally the same amount, but it's just new wording. 19:51 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 19:51 Josh Wilhelm: And yeah, I would stick with what you have. If it's something that you're kind of 19:54 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 19:56 Josh Wilhelm: wanting to go a little bit more than 19:58 Jennifer Abbott: No, no. 19:58 Josh Wilhelm: there. That's where borderline. 20:00 Jennifer Abbott: Simple update and then and then the one thing is is maybe the only thing from a design standpoint is like the big element of the essay on the page that you're looking at right now is it it is now to me perceived as more important than the content. So, I wonder if it would behoove us to make that smaller and then I mean the contents the content, but just I want to make sure that the content's most important part. 20:24 Josh Wilhelm: Right. So one one thing or one thing I'm thinking that we could do to also kind of give it because text isn't really going to give it that much of a facelift or or modernize it unless 20:33 Jennifer Abbott: No. 20:34 Josh Wilhelm: the reading the content and remember even what the previous content was on 20:38 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 20:38 Josh Wilhelm: it, which is not likely. 20:40 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 20:41 Josh Wilhelm: what I probably would do is we take these elements and I'm wondering if we have about the same size that you have here an image of A real person or not, you know like a smiling. Maybe it's an African-American woman. I don't know whatever but that 20:56 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, yeah. 20:57 Josh Wilhelm: represents who you work with or your staff that you're supplying to others that kind of thing. And then we take this element and we put it not too small, but small enough in the bottom right hand corner of that image. 21:12 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 21:12 Josh Wilhelm: So that the image itself of the real looking person goes along with what overall the Texas saying right? So commitment to identify the human element for our clients that so some kind of image that conveys what 21:27 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 21:27 Josh Wilhelm: What trying to say with the text. And then you're still able to keep that element on the image and it's do it but then it it just gives it a new Fresh look like it doesn't doesn't feel like the same old side. It feels like oh this has gotten a little bit of an uplift to it and it's a little bit modernized. So I I think from a graphical standpoint and we might want to revisit also the background that we have up here in the 21:55 Jennifer Abbott: No way. I still love. 21:56 Josh Wilhelm: oh. Well, okay. So what if instead though we do. 21:60 Jennifer Abbott: And we use it on everything. 22:01 Josh Wilhelm: No, no, but what if we do like some newer images like some newer faces back there right? 22:06 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, that would work. 22:07 Josh Wilhelm: Like I'm saying keep the same kind of overall styling, but just have have 22:10 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 22:12 Josh Wilhelm: more more faces. Okay. so that that would be 22:16 Jennifer Abbott: And that's a pretty white background too. Like Whitey face background. 22:19 Josh Wilhelm: mmm Yeah. 22:22 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 22:22 Josh Wilhelm: So I I think if we take you know, you can still keep this up here where you've got not the images that we're talking about, but just the fill 22:30 Jennifer Abbott: no. 22:30 Josh Wilhelm: where the elements then that way when 22:31 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 22:32 Josh Wilhelm: you go down to the sections now it's 22:35 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 22:35 Josh Wilhelm: corresponding with it, but it's it's a little bit updated. 22:40 Jennifer Abbott: Would it work if you you know how you were saying to put the element like in the bottom right corner? What if you put the elements like the F in the find part find out? Where do you think that'll get lost? 22:53 Josh Wilhelm: mmm You could very well. Could the only thing I'd be concerned about is it might? The whole element component might get lost. It might compete too much with the find out. 23:08 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 23:09 Josh Wilhelm: Like it might be like you might have to point it out. Someone go. Oh, see how we have an element and find out and they're like, oh I didn't even realize that. Yeah, that's clever. You don't want to have to do that. 23:17 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. Yeah. 23:19 Josh Wilhelm: So I think if you can still kind of keep it as part of the image it still I think I think keeping it as part of that graphic with whatever human 23:30 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 23:30 Josh Wilhelm: We're image. years 23:31 Jennifer Abbott: Yep, for sure. And then the one other thing so, like I said, it's all just gonna be updating content. 23:39 Josh Wilhelm: done 23:39 Jennifer Abbott: The one of the thing that I thought was really cool on the intrepidus one was they have on their last page? I don't necessarily think that we need our team done that way but I'll put that I'll put that in that they've immediate page. Which and I don't mean page. I just mean drop down like all the podcasts that they've done. 24:02 Josh Wilhelm: Let me see and go right. 24:03 Jennifer Abbott: Do you think that's worth it like do you do that on you? Well, you have your own podcast so you certainly don't do it. 24:09 Josh Wilhelm: well So media would stand would be a stand-in for. Like instead of news or articles or that kind of thing where you could 24:23 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 24:23 Josh Wilhelm: generalize it a little bit more. But I know you guys have been working 24:25 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 24:27 Josh Wilhelm: for quite some time on blog post, right? 24:30 Jennifer Abbott: Nope, we don't do those. 24:31 Josh Wilhelm: Oh, you don't okay. 24:36 Jennifer Abbott: Everybody tells us to do it. We're like f*** that we don't have the time for that. 24:39 Josh Wilhelm: Well, so here's the thing and I know the other part that you you know when you send me the email initially you were talking about SEO. 24:46 Jennifer Abbott: hmm 24:49 Josh Wilhelm: SEO is going to have to do with content. 24:51 Jennifer Abbott: Yes, I know. 24:51 Josh Wilhelm: heavily 24:52 Jennifer Abbott: I know that's why I wanted to see if there was any any in any reports that you had any words that I'm using already in the current content that that you can Do you get do you get reports like that? Like this is? I had Nikki run a health of our website and she's like it's f****** healthy. 25:10 Josh Wilhelm: yeah, the health of it doesn't really 25:13 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, but she's like I can't get your 25:13 Josh Wilhelm: I mean that that's 25:15 Jennifer Abbott: SEO. 25:15 Josh Wilhelm: well health of a website plays a role of minuscule into that of the overall SEO component. What is Gonna Hurt You biggest thing on this and we talked about this earlier from and it this is where each decision kind of takes you in a different. different way of going about this unique content that means you need to be building out Pages just like intrepidus does for their site. 25:47 Jennifer Abbott: Yep. 25:48 Josh Wilhelm: They give me just an example and just so we can kind of see them side by side. All right. So intrepidus really is brand new. 26:08 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 26:10 Josh Wilhelm: Any kind of activity started around August of this year in terms of their website of any kind of like getting picked up by the search engine. So this probably isn't a good example is not a good example to base it every anything off of 26:24 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 26:25 Josh Wilhelm: but okay. So overall from an SEO standpoint a website should never look like an EKG. 26:37 Jennifer Abbott: right 26:37 Josh Wilhelm: Which which currently your site looks like an EKG. 26:41 Jennifer Abbott: right 26:43 Josh Wilhelm: You want it to be going in a general direction of steady? Steadily going up increasing over 26:50 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 26:50 Josh Wilhelm: time, especially for how longer site has been around. Your biggest hurdle right now is you don't have content. Content in the form of individual Pages content in the form of blog posts. you don't have any of that so it's your Like rowing with no hands. 27:17 Jennifer Abbott: right 27:17 Josh Wilhelm: You're not you're not going you're not going really anywhere with it. So that would probably be I mean right now you're only getting ranked for 10 keywords. None of which are in the top three. and this is just by more like accident than anything so these are 27:37 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, yeah. 27:39 Josh Wilhelm: So these are your your top keywords right. Now. You got human element company Element business the human element. human element Ann Arbor Wide I don't know element Corp element Co element human and then HR elements LLC. So if any of these you're like well 27:58 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 27:60 Josh Wilhelm: we don't want to be known for that. Then we need to go search engine what 28:04 Jennifer Abbott: Yep, okay. 28:05 Josh Wilhelm: you do want to be known for? so Who's give me like a name of a company that is like. Unnecessarily who you want to be competing with but just I just want to show you an example of like who you feel like a Top Dog in your industry. 28:26 Jennifer Abbott: Oh God. I'm trying to think of. I guess you could go for text systems right now. They're massive though. 28:37 Josh Wilhelm: tech systems 28:38 Jennifer Abbott: Tek 28:40 Josh Wilhelm: Otk other this one. Yeah, so there are also doing Google ads. That's why they're showing up here in the sponsor results. So for their website, I bet you they're doing quite a bit. So I'm gonna 28:55 Jennifer Abbott: Well, they're like the biggest in the states. 28:56 Josh Wilhelm: yeah, but I I just want to show you kind of what should what it should be looking like Okay, so 29:03 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 29:04 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, so you notice here that obviously it was low low starts climbing skyrocketed, but state is staying pretty high on average right now. They're averaging close about 75,000 visits a month. Okay. Now, I'm not saying that that's where you necessarily want to be. 29:21 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 29:22 Josh Wilhelm: but you can see the difference here is like the domain rating is what is called like domain Authority. So it's what Google Sees as your website being an authoritative. presence for your industry your topics So they have a 72 which is fantastic. This one not so much doesn't really matter as much backlinks. They have 19,000. So it means other websites that are linking back to them to some crafting. 29:50 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, they post all their jobs and then the job boards link back. 29:53 Josh Wilhelm: And that that could be part of it. But this is more more about quality of content is what this has a refer 30:00 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 30:01 Josh Wilhelm: to referring domain names. So these two are kind of interconnected so backlinks, you might let's say have 15 backlinks from the same website that single website will be counted once under referring domains. 30:15 Jennifer Abbott: right 30:15 Josh Wilhelm: So those usually are they correlate to each other keywords. They have 34,000 over 34,000 keywords that they're ranked for 294 of them are in the top three results. Which is crazy and that is 30:31 Jennifer Abbott: hmm, right 30:32 Josh Wilhelm: intentional obviously. So if you ever want to see kind of 30:34 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 30:35 Josh Wilhelm: what keywords that you know, they're going after in the top three positions. So obviously it's gonna be a lot of their company name, right? That's to be expected. 30:44 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 30:44 Josh Wilhelm: So tech systems and variations of Texas Tech Systems, like they even have ones I think yeah with the te H systems be most people like myself typed out taker than TCH so they work really hard to get ranked for that particularly word, even though it's not part of their normal company name. 31:03 Jennifer Abbott: right 31:04 Josh Wilhelm: um, you have other one two that are getting ranked some of which that they're trying for others that they might just automatically because of being a big dog out there that they're automatically tied to but you 31:15 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 31:17 Josh Wilhelm: can see that it's all of their locations, you know, Saint Louis and over Baltimore. 31:22 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 31:23 Josh Wilhelm: So a lot of those they have a lot of individual keywords that they're going after Workforce Development models. I mean just various different but the point I'm trying to point out with this is they have a ton of content. Any kind of ranking of any kind of scale that you're looking to do requires content? Content is King when it comes to the search results. So with there are some recent laws I'd say be careful not to lean too heavily on it, but start using Chachi PT AI. Start having the start creating 32:02 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 32:03 Josh Wilhelm: first. If you haven't been playing around with it, I would say create first your outline for your articles. Tweak that and then have it then produce the Articles off of that. I know you don't have a lot of time for it. That's why. it's 32:18 Jennifer Abbott: Well, and we really have to look and see what the anandra I need to talk about this like what is the main purpose of our website and it really still is is amazing and does what we want it to do. 32:27 Josh Wilhelm: sure. 32:28 Jennifer Abbott: I just think it needs a little bit. My biggest thing is like I said is that I think you can't see what we do. If you don't know who we are. And that's on me that's content rating and I got that like I just need to update it. So as far as all the SEO stuff, I thought that we may have some good keywords in there that I was to not exclude. But clearly I don't and Texas is saying is the same way with their top ones so I don't even know that right now. I mean, I guess if it ever gets bigger, but for right now it's doing everything we need it to do. I just don't think and especially have this like new HR arm to the company where I consult I go into companies and I overall give them kind of an evaluation on the health of their HR department and then they either hire through us or they figure it out or we refer training and development to them or whatever. And so it's a new arm of our company and most most staffing agencies have that now because people want fractionally HR they don't want HR 33:32 Josh Wilhelm: Yep. 33:32 Jennifer Abbott: within their company. So like I'm an HR director for three different companies right now will people don't understand that. 33:39 Josh Wilhelm: Sure. 33:39 Jennifer Abbott: So that's my main goal is to be much clearer about what we do. 33:45 Josh Wilhelm: Yeah, but that's where don't do it so much on the individual sections here that we're looking on the site itself. That's where you do it on blog post. 33:52 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. right 33:55 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, that's where those blog posts are extremely helpful for multiple purposes. Obviously SEO is one of them but when you come across a new company and you're saying hey, we provide this service. Oh, can you tell me more? Sure. I'll send it over to you. 34:08 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 34:09 Josh Wilhelm: He sent him over the link to the article that goes in a more detail and explain what? 34:12 Jennifer Abbott: So do you just put your blog post on your own site or how do you do it? 34:15 Josh Wilhelm: You yeah. Yeah, so like for us we have it. Let's go back to our we have it labeled as thoughts. So with thoughts we're putting things out related to our industry. We're putting out, you know announcements or putting out. all kinds of things to help our potential clients that maybe are not ready just yet to commit right so think of it as like an incubation section so that for companies that 34:43 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 34:44 Josh Wilhelm: are like, well not there yet, but I'm gonna see what you guys have for tips advice suggestions, whatever it's kind of like saying, hey, we don't want to tell people that they can make their own Burgers. Well, they'll figure out on their own they can make their own Burgers what your target audience though is our people that you want. to point out say it's more benefit for you to let us make your Burgers than for you to make your own. 35:10 Jennifer Abbott: right 35:10 Josh Wilhelm: And we know how to do it better. So we're gonna give you tips on it to where they go. Oh my gosh. This is this is too much. You know what? I thought we could do this on our own. Much rather handed they obviously know what they're talking about. They know what they're doing. Let's just give it over to them. They can take care of it. 35:27 Jennifer Abbott: And these are different from the posts that you would put the once you put those tips on a post as well. 35:32 Josh Wilhelm: So these I mean you can recycle these would be ones that you put up on LinkedIn and other say here's a great 35:37 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 35:38 Josh Wilhelm: article. We just came out with talking about the you know, five tips of why you should Outsource your HR department. 35:44 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, okay. 35:45 Josh Wilhelm: You know those kind of things that are hot that like anything that's short quick where people feel like oh, you know, you're gonna give me all of the world's helpful information and five tips. Fantastic. 35:56 Jennifer Abbott: And then on that that's where we 35:57 Josh Wilhelm: Let me up. 35:57 Jennifer Abbott: would put all the podcast and everything too, right? 36:02 Josh Wilhelm: Yep. 36:02 Jennifer Abbott: But you're saying that has to be a separate page that can't be on the landing page like what I have as the one page. 36:08 Josh Wilhelm: No. No, so your site is built with WordPress. It already has the ability to have that we just need to link it. So once you start creating an articles, we'll probably have to do a couple things one is build out like this. This is considered like a listing Or List page. This shows a list of all the most recent articles, right? 36:28 Jennifer Abbott: right 36:28 Josh Wilhelm: And as you add new articles that automatically gets updated in this list. You don't have to do anything. In different or manually it automatically updates it. 36:36 Jennifer Abbott: Does it keep all of them or it boots? 36:37 Josh Wilhelm: Yeah. 36:38 Jennifer Abbott: there's only so many in it boots them 36:39 Josh Wilhelm: no, no, it has so many on the first 36:39 Jennifer Abbott: out. 36:41 Josh Wilhelm: page and then go. Okay. Let me see some older ones. 36:44 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 36:44 Josh Wilhelm: And then you go to page number two and that's got even older and then you go as far back we have gosh. I want to say like over 200 articles on our site. So, but those just get added over time. So you just keep you know new topic 36:56 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 36:59 Josh Wilhelm: again. Let chat GPT do the heavy lifting for 37:02 Jennifer Abbott: No, I know I use it all the time. 37:02 Josh Wilhelm: you. Yeah, just let it do some of the heavy lifting I will say this because we're working on some custom tools with AI. 37:12 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 37:12 Josh Wilhelm: If you haven't figured it out already. the more context the more background 37:16 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 37:16 Josh Wilhelm: information the more information you supply it the better results. 37:20 Jennifer Abbott: Yep. 37:21 Josh Wilhelm: It will spit back out to you. 37:22 Jennifer Abbott: Yep. Yep. No, I'm a pro. 37:23 Josh Wilhelm: So, you know like I would say like this say I'm looking to come like build it out in stages don't have it try and do all the things at one time. So the way you do it is you first do one chat GPT that says I'm looking for some topic ideas related to that. 37:40 Jennifer Abbott: I'll show you my deleted masks. 37:41 Josh Wilhelm: I'm gonna use this to post up on my website as a new blog post and give me some ideas for topics and it'll spit out a bunch of topics and then 37:51 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 37:52 Josh Wilhelm: you find one that you like you say. I really like this topic now help me with creating. A rough draft of an outline and then 37:60 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 37:60 Josh Wilhelm: it creates outline you say? Okay. Well, here's my adjustments to it now take this outline and I want you to expand upon it more and then 38:06 Jennifer Abbott: This is my I just sent it to this is my latest my latest Masterpiece on track gbt. 38:12 Josh Wilhelm: let me see the 38:13 Jennifer Abbott: And this is what made me think I was like, oh my God, this is so clear about what I do, but nobody would ever know it. 38:19 Josh Wilhelm: where why is my email let me just let me expand this out. Okay feeling overwhelmed and in need of guidance when it comes to HR matters, but not sure where to begin. Okay, so why? 38:48 Jennifer Abbott: That's nothing. That's like when people like well, what do you do? I just email them that. 38:53 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, so you need to get away from emailing them an individual page? 39:01 Jennifer Abbott: Yes. 39:02 Josh Wilhelm: You need to get towards. Let me send you the information and it ends up being a link that takes them right back to your website. 39:08 Jennifer Abbott: Yes. 39:10 Josh Wilhelm: And then once they're on your website, then they're able to go. Oh what what other information you have on here? 39:16 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 39:17 Josh Wilhelm: all absorbed into your stuff 39:17 Jennifer Abbott: And that results so that is an example of what would go into the the media. page, right 39:24 Josh Wilhelm: Correct. And then what you would end up doing is when I'm looking at this document you just sent me. You would do an individual in-depth article about fractional HR Direct Services. So that this one pager that you supplied me with is its own blog post, right? 39:44 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 39:46 Josh Wilhelm: And fractional HR Director Services would be linked over to the other article that goes into more detail. You're giving them a little. Synopsis of what it is in this little paragraph, right? 39:57 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 39:58 Josh Wilhelm: But if they go, oh, I I like this. It sounds just like what we need. Do you have more information that link right there then click on it. Now, it takes them over directly to another article you have that goes into lots more detail about what fractional HR how you guys do it differently or what is common out there to be looking for and yada yada, and then at the very bottom of that article says for more information if you like to learn more about this service, please contact us and here's our contact information. 40:28 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 40:29 Josh Wilhelm: so that would be how you start breaking these out and then you 40:32 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 40:33 Josh Wilhelm: should plan you need to be putting together for yourself. Probably a 90-day content calendar. 40:39 Jennifer Abbott: I already have all that done, but that's just for social media. 40:41 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. Okay. So here's the thing. You're already doing the work for social media, correct? Okay. 40:48 Jennifer Abbott: Now I'm not. 40:49 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, whoever is doing it. 40:49 Jennifer Abbott: But yes, yeah. Yeah. 40:52 Josh Wilhelm: Whatever your 90 day content calendar is pick one item to start with per month. From the 30 day content calendar that you have. 41:01 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 41:01 Josh Wilhelm: And figure out which one you're going to expand on. you're gonna write more information 41:06 Jennifer Abbott: right 41:07 Josh Wilhelm: about and it's going to turn it into an article. 41:11 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 41:12 Josh Wilhelm: That one and then it should be far enough at events. So thinking about okay you're already in November. So forget about November December. 41:18 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 41:20 Josh Wilhelm: We already have the 30 days for December planned out, right? look at that figure out which of those topics on December would be like, oh, that would be a really good one to go into more detail about take that one plan on writing an 41:34 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 41:36 Josh Wilhelm: article with Chachi PT on it. And then you're going to end up swapping out. That social pose for the new piece that you're putting together so I can be the same graphic. It can be the same kind of little teaser information, but it's going to change a little bit to say to learn more here is an article we've put together. That talks about this. 41:58 Jennifer Abbott: Right, okay. 41:59 Josh Wilhelm: So you're not changing really anything you're just expanding and going into more detail. Once you realize how easy that one is you should be doing one per week. But you start baby steps and start with one per month. 42:15 Jennifer Abbott: And then that gets posted on the website. 42:17 Josh Wilhelm: It's posted on the website first then 42:20 Jennifer Abbott: first 42:20 Josh Wilhelm: your social post is then then gonna 42:21 Jennifer Abbott: right 42:22 Josh Wilhelm: gonna link over to that one. That social post goes out. 42:27 Jennifer Abbott: Right, right, right. Okay. And then to get it on the website then I gotta get it over to you. 42:38 Josh Wilhelm: No. I'm going to show you how you can do yourself right on your own website. 42:43 Jennifer Abbott: No. Oh, okay. 42:48 Josh Wilhelm: It yes, I don't recommend writing directly in the website. 42:52 Jennifer Abbott: No, no. 42:52 Josh Wilhelm: It's not as user friendly. I mean, it's user friendly. Once you have all the text you just copy and paste it that's easy, but I don't recommend writing it directly within the website. So there's a couple things we need to do first. You get started on the Articles because that's going to take you some time to do. Okay. So look at December figure out what one topic you're gonna go after. And then write an article up on that. Okay. That's your your homework to do. 43:23 Jennifer Abbott: Except it's not gonna happen before December. 43:25 Josh Wilhelm: Well, I'm gonna make sure that you 43:27 Jennifer Abbott: It's happening, right? 43:27 Josh Wilhelm: you you're gonna pace yourself out and paint yourself out each week. You're going to do a little bit just a little bit just a little bit even if you do each day just a little teeny tiny little bit. 43:39 Jennifer Abbott: right 43:40 Josh Wilhelm: the teeny tiny little bit I mean heck you have ai at your beck and call. That will make this so easy for you. It will probably know joke once you figure out how easy this is it will take you. Our Max to write an article. That's what editing that's with 43:58 Jennifer Abbott: right 44:00 Josh Wilhelm: cleaning it up modifying it an hour total and that's being generous that that's being probably more than what you need, but I'm giving you more time. 44:09 Jennifer Abbott: right 44:10 Josh Wilhelm: For probably an hour for a single article. That's it. 44:13 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 44:14 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. So what we do need to do in preparation for that ahead of time though is we need to put together a design using the same or similar elements that we have? No pun intended similar elements that we have from the home page and design 44:28 Jennifer Abbott: right 44:29 Josh Wilhelm: out like what you're seeing here for us, but your own version of it of a listing blog page. 44:35 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 44:35 Josh Wilhelm: If you want to call it media, that's perfectly fine. You're not to call blog. 44:38 Jennifer Abbott: Will you scroll down a little bit so I can see all the other yellow ones? Oh, I see what you've done. Okay. 44:43 Josh Wilhelm: So now we've done a little bit different where each color represents a category. so or no, and I know you don't I've 44:50 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, I don't need that. 44:52 Josh Wilhelm: just I'm explaining why there is 44:53 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, yeah. 44:54 Josh Wilhelm: different colors on you. 44:55 Jennifer Abbott: No, that's a good explanation. 44:56 Josh Wilhelm: but 44:57 Jennifer Abbott: So then basically you will help me with a basic design. And then I dump in a picture. a title and the article 45:08 Josh Wilhelm: correct. So here's here's like another site. This is this is the new business. 45:14 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 45:15 Josh Wilhelm: So see how this doesn't have any images. It's just a blog posts. 45:19 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 45:20 Josh Wilhelm: It's just like so there's multitude different layouts we could do so you can do it like kind of just like they 45:24 Jennifer Abbott: Mm-hmm. 45:25 Josh Wilhelm: did where on their media page it was. That's exactly what these are. These are just blog articles. They don't have them clickable except 45:31 Jennifer Abbott: right 45:32 Josh Wilhelm: for the title, but that's essentially what this is. 45:36 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 45:37 Josh Wilhelm: It's exactly what it is. So they have two pages worth these 45:39 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 45:40 Josh Wilhelm: they haven't been around for very long, but you can do the exact same thing and we can have out and look different. You can have images with them and make sure that you're uploading. It's like this one has image with it, but the rest don't so we wouldn't. 45:52 Jennifer Abbott: And then what goes on the social media that that my gal does it just is basically she's just doing a graphic with a title anyhow, and then it's more of a read more and then it clicks on to my website. 46:04 Josh Wilhelm: Only the post that you actually have supporting additional content for 46:07 Jennifer Abbott: Yes, yes. 46:08 Josh Wilhelm: yeah, correct. 46:08 Jennifer Abbott: Yes, okay. 46:09 Josh Wilhelm: Yeah. So social media shouldn't really be different any different than you're already doing. The only thing is you are helping to 46:14 Jennifer Abbott: aha 46:17 Josh Wilhelm: if you should be already as the business owner, you know this industry better than she does you guide her on topics. That should be talked about. 46:25 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, I do. All right. Yeah, okay. 46:26 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. So you're already doing that it that stage is when you're already thinking ahead of which one do you want to turn into an article? 46:35 Jennifer Abbott: right 46:35 Josh Wilhelm: Like well the hot topic for that month? 46:37 Jennifer Abbott: right 46:38 Josh Wilhelm: so then you would start prepping and 46:38 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 46:40 Josh Wilhelm: let her know ahead of time. Say hey this one I'm gonna end up doing the article for it. So get the graphic get the title for it, you know do like what you normally do but understand that the graphic I'm going to need your help with also is going to go on the blog page. So make sure you have two versions of it one. That's gonna go for social media size and one that's gonna be for the blog post size. So with us screening a listing page for you the layout of it and building 47:11 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 47:11 Josh Wilhelm: and constructing it. So then then you have so like for example here this one here if you click on it actually takes you to this is what then would be considered like the blog post itself. Right. 47:23 Jennifer Abbott: right 47:23 Josh Wilhelm: So this has a different little bit slightly different format than the other Pages you looked at. 47:28 Jennifer Abbott: right 47:28 Josh Wilhelm: Right, so we would lay this page out the listing page and those are two primary pages that you need designed up and laid out. once you have those then you're off 47:37 Jennifer Abbott: right 47:39 Josh Wilhelm: the races you'll be able to post as many blog posts into the future as you want. 47:43 Jennifer Abbott: So what are the two different designs? 47:45 Josh Wilhelm: So you got your listings page here. This is like a listings page. Here's another one like I showed you this one and then here's also 47:51 Jennifer Abbott: And those are just articles, right? 47:53 Josh Wilhelm: these are just links to it. Correct. So it's it's a list of all the blog 47:56 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 47:58 Josh Wilhelm: articles. Then from that point then you have the individual page like when someone clicks and says Okay. I want to read more about this particular article that has its own individual layout. 48:13 Jennifer Abbott: Got it. 48:14 Josh Wilhelm: So those are the two primary Pages you're going to need to have laid out design developed that's connected to your site. doesn't cost anything more but the third component is we're going to obviously have to add a link at the top of your site that would then be Media or Whatever you want to call it blog articles news. 48:35 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 48:36 Josh Wilhelm: Multitude of different titles you can choose from but we would add another one right in here probably in between our services and contact us. 48:42 Jennifer Abbott: Right, that's exactly what I was thinking. 48:44 Josh Wilhelm: Click on that that'll then take you to your new listings page that we were showing like maybe something 48:50 Jennifer Abbott: hmm 48:50 Josh Wilhelm: like this and then then your articles would automatically so as you create new articles, they will automatically show up in the listing page as the latest one. 49:02 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 49:03 Josh Wilhelm: So once we developed those pages, we would create a loom video or a recorded video for you showing you exactly how to create a new blog post. 49:13 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 49:14 Josh Wilhelm: And what I would ask for you to do is by you creating that very first one then I can have our team use your first article as the example to show you in the video when we record it of how to take your actual article and how to apply it to a post on your site. 49:35 Jennifer Abbott: Wouldn't it be best to start off with what I have right now with that one that I gave you. 49:40 Josh Wilhelm: Yeah, you can start with that one, but I believe. 49:42 Jennifer Abbott: But I think this number is not the time to start it because that's like my most important one. 49:48 Josh Wilhelm: No, I I'm saying you're you're behind the curve already. 49:51 Jennifer Abbott: I know. 49:51 Josh Wilhelm: So instead of being the to just you know Ponder upon I'm already behind the curve was me. I'm not gonna get started just start better best today is to start today rather than Ponder upon the past that you didn't. So just start even so it doesn't I'm 50:04 Jennifer Abbott: All right. 50:08 Josh Wilhelm: just giving you ideas if you want to take that one that you've already created and build upon it to create another more in depth article about the HR. services 50:19 Jennifer Abbott: Well, when I guess my question is is when that one that like I know that it's not terribly in depth, but there's a s*** ton of content on that page. 50:27 Josh Wilhelm: No, well. It's a little bit of content. Don't don't get too far ahead of 50:32 Jennifer Abbott: Well, it's four different like 50:32 Josh Wilhelm: yourself. 50:33 Jennifer Abbott: sectors of what we do. I know you're saying excuse. 50:35 Josh Wilhelm: I know but that's as that's a teeny tiny small paragraph for the four most important things you do as a service. 50:41 Jennifer Abbott: right 50:41 Josh Wilhelm: So what I'm getting at is yes, absolutely. This can be serving as an article on its own. But get started on building out 50:49 Jennifer Abbott: right 50:50 Josh Wilhelm: four distinct Services as individual articles all on their own. Start just start with one of them. 50:56 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 50:59 Josh Wilhelm: Throughout the HR Director Services as the one that you want to start with because you're just going kind of top to bottom fine or you go no really this one's more important than the other three or four whatever didn't go with whatever you want to but I'm saying take one of those and expand upon it for its own article. 51:18 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 51:19 Josh Wilhelm: Okay. 51:20 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 51:21 Josh Wilhelm: All right. So my action steps that I will have for you is I will put together a proposal for you estimate for 51:29 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 51:29 Josh Wilhelm: creating the blog listing page as well as the individual blog post page. So those two go hand in hand together. Then I will also get you on that same estimate but a separate line item so that you can choose to or not choose to your choice, but the ADA compliance as well as the terms and conditions and again, you can choose those and check the box or not. Check the box. Whatever you prefer. While I'm putting that together, do you have a preference just so I set it up correctly. Do you want or you more leaning towards doing it as a yearly For the Ada in terms of conditions or would you more of a monthly? Okay, so I will put those as monthly breakdowns rather than yearly 52:13 Jennifer Abbott: And then I also need an estimate on just all the content update that I'm going to do. 52:18 Josh Wilhelm: I would say this is if you do the blog pages won't charge anything for 52:24 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 52:25 Josh Wilhelm: the content update as long as you have the content ready and you're 52:27 Jennifer Abbott: All right. 52:28 Josh Wilhelm: like look, this is literally I just when you copy and paste it and it 52:32 Jennifer Abbott: Yep. 52:32 Josh Wilhelm: that simple, I won't charge anything for that. 52:35 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. All right. 52:36 Josh Wilhelm: Until you know just to remind you because I totally forgot about this due. I don't charge you guys anything for hosting. So you have never been charged for 52:44 Jennifer Abbott: Oh. 52:46 Josh Wilhelm: hosting a single day. 52:49 Jennifer Abbott: Huh? 52:49 Josh Wilhelm: So that normally normally on any client that we have the minimum that people pay is 99 a month. 52:56 Jennifer Abbott: Thanks, Josh. 52:57 Josh Wilhelm: So I really I'm like well, it's too late now. I can't start all of a sudden charging them for something that for a couple years now, they haven't been paying for so I'm like I can't charge them for that. 53:08 Jennifer Abbott: right 53:08 Josh Wilhelm: So. 53:09 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. Okay, you gave me a lot to think about. 53:14 Josh Wilhelm: So pace yourself baby steps with content. So obviously the priorities in this is think about first what content you want to update on the homepage. That's number one. 53:24 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 53:25 Josh Wilhelm: Number two is you already have a head start on potentially a secondary article. You already have one, which is that lists of services you provide the secondary is what service off of one of those that and I would say if 53:38 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 53:39 Josh Wilhelm: you're gonna do the effort to create the article plan to swap whatever it is, whichever one in December that you already had slated to be done swap it out with the article that you're gonna then create. To get maximum use out of it rather than just well, I have an article over here and we have different social posts on you know December over here. Let one serve as the other. 54:04 Jennifer Abbott: Well, or I could just do a brand new one and just do something about employees over the holiday seasons, whatever and then that it's December and then in jail because January I want to be business people aren't f****** reading anything in December. 54:17 Josh Wilhelm: No, I in fact, I I mean December which is probably gonna be best for you is think about things that are tax related. like tax topics that are along your 54:24 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah. 54:27 Josh Wilhelm: lines like hey bias taking on your HR Services can save you taxes for coming into the new year kind of thing. However you want to do it, but that's usually when you want to kind of do for B2B tax season. Usually November December our good topics just to prep everyone and let remind them about a tax or coming up. Here's a great way that we can help you save some of those taxes. 54:49 Jennifer Abbott: Hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay. All right. 54:55 Josh Wilhelm: Okay, so I'll get to work on the estimate for you'll get that over to you. Give me these Wednesday. Give me till Friday. 55:03 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 55:05 Josh Wilhelm: And I'll also give you a little sneak peek on what we're doing with our AI. 55:09 Jennifer Abbott: Okay. 55:10 Josh Wilhelm: That so this conversation we're having right now. What we're working on is an automatic sow tool. So it takes our transcript from our conversation that we're having right now. 55:22 Jennifer Abbott: right 55:23 Josh Wilhelm: Turns it first into a summary of the conversation. Then it turns it into a problems and goals bullet lists. And that problems and goes bullets gets turned into action items for sow. automatically So anything so anything that you want for proposals that are custom tailored to your conversations that you've had this is that helps with. 55:50 Jennifer Abbott: awesome 55:51 Josh Wilhelm: Um, yeah. 55:52 Jennifer Abbott: You need a f****** young intern to do this s***. 55:55 Josh Wilhelm: I I'm here. I'm totally with you on that one. totally with you 55:59 Jennifer Abbott: I'm too old for this. The problem is I have all the knowledge. 56:04 Josh Wilhelm: But here's the thing. 56:05 Jennifer Abbott: Oh. 56:07 Josh Wilhelm: You build up the process to do it and streamline it. And you feed the engine of knowledge with your knowledge? 56:14 Jennifer Abbott: well knowing I know. 56:15 Josh Wilhelm: and then your team doesn't have to be all that skilled. 56:18 Jennifer Abbott: I know. 56:19 Josh Wilhelm: And so they they will do all the work. 56:22 Jennifer Abbott: Yeah, yeah. 56:23 Josh Wilhelm: So, all right. 56:24 Jennifer Abbott: All right. Well, you have to add s*** to my New Year's resolution goals for work. Thanks Josh. 56:29 Josh Wilhelm: No problem. I'm that's what I'm here for every single time. 56:32 Jennifer Abbott: And yeah, thanks. All right.

The client expressed the need to update the content on their website, with a particular focus on the site's pages. They are considering adding an extra page, which may be encompassed by the content update, and they are contemplating the removal of the \\\"FILL\\\" acronym in favor of a more relatable human element and basic branding.\\n\\nThe client has noticed that their competitor, Intrepidus Talent Solutions, features more communicative content, prompting a desire to update their own content to achieve similar clarity. This comparison has served as a catalyst for the client's interest in refining their website's messaging.\\n\\nIn addition to content updates, the client recognizes the necessity of ADA compliance for their website. We discussed the significance of web accessibility and the potential legal consequences of non-compliance. To address this, the client was informed about a third-party tool that facilitates ADA compliance for a monthly fee of approximately $100.\\n\\nWith new California laws affecting data collection, the client needs to update their terms and conditions. We have suggested a subscription service that provides regular updates to terms and conditions for about $50 per month, ensuring the client remains compliant with the latest regulations.\\n\\nThe client's website currently suffers from poor keyword ranking due to insufficient content. To rectify this, we proposed the use of AI tools like ChatGPT to generate content and to create a 90-day content calendar. We also recommended that the client begin blogging and crafting more in-depth articles about their services to bolster their SEO efforts.\\n\\nTo improve sales conversion, we suggested integrating a scheduling service like Calendly with the contact form, which has been shown to enhance the conversion rate from leads to meetings. This direct booking approach could streamline the lead engagement process and potentially increase client acquisition.\\n\\nThe client is also considering a website redesign, which would include updating images and possibly the background. They wish to ensure that content remains the focal point of the site, which may involve resizing the large homepage element.\\n\\nThe client has introduced a new HR consultancy arm to their company and requires the website to clearly represent this new service. Additionally, we discussed the possibility of adding a media page to feature podcasts and other media that relate to the company's services.\\n\\nAs action steps moving forward, the client will receive an estimate for the creation of a blog listing page and an individual blog post page. They have been advised to prioritize updating the homepage content and then to proceed with writing articles for their services. The client will benefit from complimentary hosting and content updates, provided they supply the content ready for implementation. Despite a delay in their content creation schedule, the client was encouraged to initiate blog content creation, focusing on tax-related topics for B2B in December.\",\"created_at\":\"2023-11-29T18:18:48.000000Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2023-11-29T18:18:48.000000Z\"},\"scope_of_work\":{\"id\":1,\"problemGoalID\":1,\"scopeText\":\"- **Scope of Work for Website Update and Enhancement:**\\n\\n  -
