**Call Participants:**
- Jennifer Abbott
- Josh Wilhelm

**Meeting Summary:**

The call between Jennifer Abbott and Josh Wilhelm focused on the need for updating the content on Defense Acquisition Solutions Group\'s website, particularly to clarify the services offered. Jennifer expressed that while she is happy with the site\'s design, she believes the content needs to be more communicative and possibly restructured to better convey the company\'s services. She referenced a competitor\'s website, Intrepidus Talent Solutions, as having content that is clearer but not vastly different from their own.

Josh Wilhelm raised the importance of ADA compliance for the website, noting that it has become a significant legal issue for businesses post-COVID. He explained the benefits of a third-party tool that makes websites more accessible and protects against legal action. He also emphasized the necessity of having updated terms and conditions due to recent California laws regarding data collection.

Additionally, Josh suggested integrating a scheduling tool like Calendly into the contact form to improve lead conversion rates. He shared that doing so had significantly increased their own conversion rate.

The conversation also covered the importance of SEO and the creation of unique content through blog posts, utilizing tools like ChatGPT to assist in content creation. Josh advised Jennifer on how to create a 90-day content calendar and to start with one article per month, possibly focusing on tax-related topics for the upcoming December.

Josh agreed to provide an estimate for the creation of a blog listing page and an individual blog post page, as well as separate line items for ADA compliance and terms and conditions. He also offered a sneak peek into an AI tool they are developing to streamline the creation of statements of work (SOW) from conversation transcripts.

  - Identify and prioritize the content updates needed for the homepage.
  - Decide on which service to expand into an in-depth article and begin writing it using ChatGPT.

The client is considering adding an additional page but is open to integrating this information into the existing content. They also wish to declutter the site by removing unnecessary "FILL" elements, resizing page elements to prioritize content, and making the human element logo more prominent to leverage their established branding.

  In terms of compliance, there is a need for **ADA compliance** to safeguard against potential legal issues. A third-party tool, recommended by Josh Wilhelm, which costs approximately $100/month, has been suggested for this purpose. Additionally, the website\'s **terms and conditions** require an update to align with new California data collection laws, with an ongoing service cost estimated at $50/month.

  Improving **sales conversion** is another critical objective. It has been suggested that integrating the contact form with a scheduling tool like Calendly could enhance conversion rates.
